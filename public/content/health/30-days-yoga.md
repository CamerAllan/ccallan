I recently started a free yoga programme, [30 Days of Yoga](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLui6Eyny-UzwxbWCWDbTzEwsZnnROBTIL).
I wasn't sure if I'd get much out of it, but after the first day I realised how poor my flexibility was.

I've just finished the first week, and I can feel the progress I've made.
The instructor (Adriene) can be a bit annoying at times, but the videos offer something different every day and always leave me clearheaded.
