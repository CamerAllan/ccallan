I like the concept of [Gentle](https://gentle.app).

It's an anonymous social network where users share their concerns and receive reassuring replies written by other users.
I haven't tried it out (there's only an iOS beta as of 2020/4/27) but it sounds like a wholesome idea.

I imagine they'll have to lean hard on spam filters and user reports to reduce abuse - hopefully this doesn't plague the site too much but the internet is what it is.
