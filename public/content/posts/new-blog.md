We've all been told (in no uncertain terms) to stay home.

This is a horrifying thought for some, even before considering the dangers of COVID-19. I'm one of the lucky ones - my hobbies and interests (read: computers) lend themselves pretty well to staying indoors! I know others who will wrestle with their personal quarantine far more than myself.

Having said that, it seems wise to start doing something a bit different - not least to stop the days from blurring into each other.

## So I got thinking

> *'Maybe I should start a blog'*

I've never been someone who writes for fun. Up until now, I've only taken the time to put pen to paper when it's been necessary - mainly coursework and exams. So it's maybe time to give it a go under more favorable circumstances.

So, after thinking for a while I decided this might not be a horrendous idea, for a few reasons:

### Accountability

When it comes to starting a new project, I have a problem with persistence. As soon as I get to the point where I believe I could successfully bring something to completion, I lose interest. It's as though knowing I can do it is enough.

I hope that if keep a public log of my progress on these projects, I'll be more likely to see them through.

### Style

I don't know about you, but I don't have to think about the way I speak - it just happens. Sadly I can't say the same for my writing. If all goes to plan, I'll develop a style I'm comfortable with, allowing me to focus on the *content* of these posts rather than their *phrasing*.

### Reflection

It has quickly become clear that looking after our mental wellbeing is going to be a key part of getting through this pandemic. Along this vein, I've always found that writing my thoughts down helps me to compartmentalize them. If there's a time to turn this bit of mental housekeeping into a habit, surely it's now!

## What's next

It's taken me about as long to write this as it did to build the site it's hosted on - but I'm enjoying the process of reframing writing from being a chore to a hobby.

I hope I'll be able to get out a couple of longer posts every month, maybe with some smaller bits and bobs in between.

See you next time!
