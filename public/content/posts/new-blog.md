![*certain terms*](stay-home.jpg)

We've all been told (in no uncertain terms) to stay home.

I know this is a horrifying thought for some, even before considering the dangers of COVID-19.
Fortunately for me, my hobbies and interests (read: computers) lend themselves pretty well to staying indoors!
I know many others will wrestle with their time in lock-down more than myself.

Having said that, it still seemed wise to start doing something a bit different - not least to stop the days from blurring into one another.

## So I started thinking

> *'Maybe I should start a blog'*

I've never been someone who writes for fun.
Up until now, I've only taken the time to put pen to paper when it's been necessary - primarily for coursework and exams.
So I thought it was time to give it a go under more favourable circumstances.
I decided that starting a blog might *not* be a *horrendous* idea, for the following reasons:

### Accountability

My computer is home to dozens of unfinished projects.
They generally go like this:

I spend days working feverishly on the exciting, core part of the problem - after which one of these two things happen:

1. 'Breakthrough! I can see the light at the end of the tunnel! I'll have this done in no time, all that's left is to implement the other, boring, 90% of the work...'
2. 'I could probably figure this out but it would take some considerable research, I'm sure I've seen a paper on how to do this somewhere...'

Either way, a few days later I'll have moved onto the first 10% of something else.
My hope with the blog is that by keeping a public log of my progress on these projects, I'll have more incentive to push through to the end.

### Confidence

I don't have to think about the way I speak.
It just happens.

Sadly I can't say the same for my writing.
Writing takes me *ages*.
It's taken me about as long to write this first post as it has to build the site it's hosted on.

Given that I've made it this far, I'm confident that with practice I'll develop a style I'm comfortable with, allowing me to focus on the content of these posts rather than their phrasing.

### Reflection

It has quickly become clear that looking after our mental wellbeing is going to be a key part of getting through this pandemic.
Along this vein, I've always found that getting my thoughts onto paper helps me to compartmentalize them.

From my experience so far, I can say with confidence that most of what I write down will not make it into a post - but that's ok.
If there's a time to turn this bit of mental housekeeping into a habit, it's surely now.

## What's next

So, that's a bit about what I'll be doing with my quarantine.
I don't expect anyone to keep up with this, as it's more for myself than any particular audience, but it's here if you want it.
For now, I'm aiming to put out a couple of longer posts every month, maybe with some smaller bits and bobs in between.

That's it for now,

Stay inside!
