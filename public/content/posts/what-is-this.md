We're staring down the barrel of a long time indoors.
This alone is a horrifying thought for some, even before considering the dangers of COVID-19.
I'm one of the lucky ones - my hobbies and interests lend themselves pretty well to staying indoors! I know others who'll wrestle with this confinement far more than myself.

Having said that, it seemed healthy to set myself a challenge of doing something different - not least to stop the days from blurring into each other.

> *'Maybe I should start a blog'*

I've never been a particularly good writer.
That's not to say I think I'm *bad* at writing, but I don't consider it one of my strengths.
So, you might wonder - *why on earth are you starting a blog*? Well, I've put some thought into that:

### Accountability

When it comes to starting new projects, I have a persistence issue. I get very excited and pour all of my free time into it, then within a week or two I'm settling for the fact that I could *probably* get it done if I had the motivation.
I have a theory that if I publicly host progress on these projects, I'll be less likely to give up on them early.

### Confidence

I don't know about you, but I don't have to think about the way I speak - it just happens. Sadly I can't say the same for my writing. Hopefully, developing a style I'm comfortable with will allow me to focus on the *content* of these posts rather than their *phrasing*.

### Reflection

It's quickly become clear that looking after our mental wellbeing is going to be a key part of getting through the pandemic. Along this vein, I've always found that writing my thoughts down helps me to compartmentalize them. If there's a time to turn this bit of mental housekeeping into a habit, surely it's now!

### Pleasure

Finally, there's a part of me that knows this blog is just an excuse to build a pretty website for myself. *Hopefully the other parts of me won't find out*.

## That's it for now

If you know me (Given we're at an early stage in my meteoric rise to stardom I suspect you do), you'll know that this is a weird thing for me to do!
I encourage you to do something that's weird for you, too.
Maybe that's picking up running, learning a language or starting a blog!
Or perhaps it's something entirely unproductive - there's no harm in shaking things up.
