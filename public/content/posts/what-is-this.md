# What is this?

There are a few things I'm still undecided on regarding *this thing*. 

## What do I want from this blog/open-diary thing?

- I'd like to become more confident typing up free-form pieces like this one. I currently feel quite self-aware of how communicate when writing - I hope this will fade with practice.
- Writing thoughts down feels like a healthy bit of reflection, particularly during a [quarantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Wuhan_coronavirus_outbreak).
- When working on other projects, I'd like to keep some sort of dev-diary as a form of accountability.
- Maintaining the infrastructure around keeps me in the fast-moving front-end loop.

## What are the problems?

- I'd like the posts here to be consistent. I'd like to avoid changing my mind in a month and having a post history with a mixture of high and low quality writing.

## What are the solutions?

- I'm considering having two channels, a blog, and a 'status'. Perhaps you can only see the last `n` statuses, to provide some distinction between the two.

## Some other outstanding questions

- How do I separate technical posts from the rest?
  - Some sort of tag system? Or simply a tech on/off filter somewhere.
- Do I edit posts over time or make a point to leave them as they are?
