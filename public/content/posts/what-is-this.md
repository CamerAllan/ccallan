## Hello there, world

> *'I should start a blog'*

This was my first thought when faced with the prospect of indefinite self-isolation due to Covid-19. Does that make sense to you? Maybe not - I'll try and lay out my thought process:

### Reflection

Staring down potential months of almost quarantine, I recognised that taking care of my mental health would be an important part of getting through this strange time. I've found in the past that when there's too much going on in my head, I benefit hugely from just writing them down. What better time to make this a habit than now?

### Communication

I'm notoriously bad at reaching out to family. I can happily speak for days once we get chatting, but for whatever reason I struggle to keep people in the loop. I thought a good step towards loop-keeping would be to just put my thoughts out there, and let whoever is interested subscribe to them.

### Confidence

As I type this I'm acutely aware of how I *sound*. Not the clicking of my keyboard, but the style in which I'm writing. I don't have to think about the way I speak - it just happens. I hope that with practice, the same will happen for my writing. I want to develop a style I'm comfortable with, allowing me to focus on content over phrasing.

### Accountability

There are many things for which I wish I were held accountable. I probably wouldn't have skipped my workout this morning if I knew that there was somebody out there that would *know*. But nobody knew. The only person I had to lie to is myself! Easy! My theory is that by keeping a public log of my longer term projects, I give myself another incentive to keep going - documentation becomes a reward.

### Enjoyment

Finally there's a part of me that knows this blog is just an excuse to build a nice website for myself. Hopefully the other parts won't find out.

## Some bits I've not figured out yet

There's still a lot left to puzzle out about the form this blog will take:

### There must be a theme to all of this

Choosing a theme sounds like the kind of thing that would leave me paralyzed by indecision for weeks, so I'm going to skip that and hope it figures itself out.

### Surely you have a target audience

I want everybody to be able to read this, so I'll be assuming little-to-no technical knowledge. Hopefully it'll be interesting whether you know me or not, whether we have similar interests or not. It remains to be seen whether this is at all achievable by anyone, let alone me.

## See you again soon

The posts on this site aren't going anywhere (perhaps I'll update them and they'll only get better - like a cheese), so you're free to tune in at your own rate.

See you soon!
