> *'Maybe I should start a blog'*

This was one of my first thoughts when I considered the prospect of indefinite self-isolation due to Covid-19. I've taken the time to think about why:

### Reflection

We're all facing months of isolation - clearly mental wellbeing is going to be an important part of getting through this thing. In the past, I've found that when there's a lot going on in my head I benefit hugely from writing it all down. If there's a time to turn this into a habit, it's now.

### Confidence

I don't have to think about the way I speak - it just happens. Hopefully with practice, the same will happen for my writing. Developing a style I'm comfortable will let me focus on content over phrasing.

### Accountability

My theory here is that in keeping a publicly available log of my progress against longer term projects, I'll give myself another incentive to keep going - documenting my success becomes a reward.

### Pleasure

Finally, there's a part of me that knows this blog is just an excuse to build a nice website for myself. Hopefully the other parts of me won't find out.

## That's it for now

I'm keeping this one brief, but I'll be back soon!
