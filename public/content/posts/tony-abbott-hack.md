[When you browse Instagram and find former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott's passport number](https://mango.pdf.zone/finding-former-australian-prime-minister-tony-abbotts-passport-number-on-instagram)

A really entertaining post. It's pretty long but well worth a read. TL;DR: Don't post pictures of your boarding pass. Some of them effectively have your credentials plastered on the front.

As an aside, reading this has inspired me to try to put more personality into my posts. Gotta ease into that though.
