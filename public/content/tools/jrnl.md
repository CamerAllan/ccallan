I recently started using [jrnl](https://jrnl.sh/) while I work.

It's a lightweight journal (you might have guessed) that's made it easy for me to keep notes as I go.

I've added a simple `jrnl -from yesterday` to the end of my `.bashrc` so that whenever I open a terminal I can pick up where I left off. This also serves as a reminder to add new entries that day.
