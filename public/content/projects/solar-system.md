![Jupiter in orbit](jupiter.gif) 

I spent a couple of days experimenting with solar systems defined as a function of time, rather than a simulation of the forces involved. It didn't go very far, but I like how this gif came out. The scene is pretty simple, but by capturing the game window at low res and with loads of bloom, the flicker of the planet gives a nice effect. 

Try and catch the twinkle of a planet on the far side of the star!
