This is a pretty mad one but believe it or not I made [this very website](https://ccallan.dev/) with my own hands.

I thought it would be cool to have a place to share stuff I liked which was less social media-ey than the other options.

Each post is a markdown file that gets whizzed through some radical javascript until it looks like what you're reading now. That all makes writing pretty frictionless, which it's gonna have to be for me to have any chance of keeping this up.

I plan on updating the site's [README](https://github.com/CamerAllan/ccallan/blob/master/README.md) with technical details at some point, probably after I tidy the source up. It's a bit messy at the moment *but that's fine* because it's *my* website and *I say so*.

### What's cookin'

- I'm wanting to get into RSS feeds, so I'll find out how that works and `hook it up` at some point. 
- Comments would be sweet but I imagine I'd have to pay for the pleasure of nobody writing any. 
- A footer
- These days anybody that's hip has a dark theme so that's coming
- Heaps of **w h i t e s p a c e**
