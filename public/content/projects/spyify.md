[Spyify](https://github.com/CamerAllan/spyify) is a [mitmproxy](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy) script that allows you to record what your friends are listening to on Spotify.

I made it with the intention of doing some kind of analysis on the data, but ran into issues with keeping the desktop client awake for periods of more than a day.
This meant that I'd have to use the client on the recording device daily, which makes it impractical for long-term use.

Take a look if you're interested in producing your own [Spotify wrapped](https://open.spotify.com/genre/2019-page) content, for you or your friends!
