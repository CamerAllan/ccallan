This is probably the best game I've ever played. 
[Return of the Obra Dinn](https://obradinn.com/) places you aboard an abandoned ship, and tasks you with identifying each of the ~60 listed crew members and recording how they died.
This puts you in the role of a detective in a way I never would have thought possible, outside of the real-world. 
You're forced to pay attention to your surroundings, identifying and taking note of details that could be helpful further down the line.

What else does it need?
- Great soundtrack
- Looks lovely
- Strong candidate for playing with others

I can't recommend this game enough.
