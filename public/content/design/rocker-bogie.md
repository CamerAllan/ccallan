The [Rocker-Bogie system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocker-bogie) is NASA's elegant suspension arrangement used in the Mars rovers. 

I've recently tried to build such a system in [Unity](https://unity.com/), although I'm yet to get the default wheel colliders to play nicely with all the hinges.
